# Speed up APEX pages loading : Practical Guide

<!-- Mention of common page and application loading performance challenges. -->

Common challenges in page and application loading performance, particularly in the context of Oracle APEX and web applications in general, include Slow SQL Queries, High Server Load, Inefficient Application Logic, Network Latency, Client-Side Rendering Issues, others.

Addressing these challenges often requires a combination of optimizing SQL queries, refining application logic, leveraging caching, minimizing client-side processing, and ensuring adequate server resources and efficient network configurations. Regular monitoring and performance tuning are key to identifying and mitigating these issues.

## Section 1: Understanding Performance in Oracle APEX

<!-- - What is considered good performance in Oracle APEX: -->

!!! quote "Good performance in Oracle APEX, as in any web-based application environment, is primarily defined by the responsiveness and efficiency of the application."

Here are the key aspects that are generally considered when evaluating good performance in Oracle APEX:

1. **Fast Page Load Times:** Slow page load times can lead to a poor user experience and may cause users to abandon the application.

2. **Efficient Database Interactions:** This includes optimized SQL queries that return results quickly and efficiently, appropriate indexing, and effective use of PL/SQL to handle business logic.

3. **Minimal Server Resource Usage:** This includes optimal use of memory, CPU, and disk I/O. Efficient use of resources ensures that the application can handle a higher number of concurrent users without degradation in performance.

4. **Responsive User Interface (UI):** The UI should be responsive and interactive, providing immediate feedback to user actions. This involves efficient use of AJAX, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS to create a smooth and dynamic user experience.

5. **Scalability:** A well-performing APEX application should be able to maintain its responsiveness as the number of users grows.

6. **Low Latency in Network Communications:** The time taken for data to travel across the network between the client and the server (and back) should be minimal. Network latency can significantly affect the perceived speed of an application.

7. **Effective Error and Exception Handling:** This includes providing useful error messages to users and ensuring that one user’s problematic request does not impact the performance for others.

8. **Consistency Across Different Browsers and Devices:** The application should perform consistently across different web browsers and devices, providing a similar level of responsiveness and efficiency.

9. **Minimal Bottlenecks and Locks:** Particularly in database operations. This ensures that multiple users can interact with the application simultaneously without encountering significant delays or locks.

10. **Regular Monitoring and Optimization:** Continuously monitoring application performance and regularly optimizing based on the insights gained is a part of maintaining good performance. This proactive approach helps in identifying and rectifying potential performance issues before they impact the users.

> In summary, good performance in Oracle APEX is characterized by fast, efficient, scalable, and consistent application behavior that provides a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Section 2: Identifying Performance Problems

![Perfomance Tools](./assets/images/performance_tools.png)

<!-- - How to use diagnostic and monitoring tools in Oracle APEX. -->

Using diagnostic and monitoring tools in Oracle APEX is essential for identifying and addressing performance issues. Here’s a guide on how to effectively utilize these tools:

**APEX Advisor:**

- Purpose: The APEX Advisor checks for best practices, security issues, and potential performance problems in your application.
- How to Use: Navigate to the “App Builder”, select your application, and choose “Utilities” from the right-hand sidebar. Then, click on “Advisor” to run it. It will report issues categorized by severity, allowing you to focus on critical problems first.

**Debugging:**

- Purpose: Debugging allows you to trace the execution of your application, showing the steps it takes and how long each step takes.
- How to Use: To enable debugging, add &pdebug=YES to the end of your application URL or click the “Debug” option within the App Builder. Review the debug reports in the “View Debug” option under the developer toolbar to identify slow-running pages or processes.

**Page Timing:**

- Purpose: Page timing helps in understanding the time taken for various components of a page to load.

- How to Use: This feature can be accessed from the developer toolbar at the bottom of your application page in run-time. It provides a breakdown of timing for SQL queries, PL/SQL processes, page rendering, etc.

**SQL Workshop:**

- Purpose: SQL Workshop includes tools like Object Browser, SQL Commands, and Query Builder to work with your database objects and queries.

- How to Use: Use these tools to execute and monitor the performance of SQL queries directly, identify long-running queries, and experiment with query optimizations.

**Application Logs:**

- Purpose: Application logs record various events and errors that occur within your application.

- How to Use: Regularly review these logs (accessible via the App Builder) for any anomalies or errors that could be impacting performance.

**Monitoring Database Performance:**

- Purpose: Monitoring the underlying Oracle database is crucial for overall application performance.

- How to Use: Utilize Oracle database tools like Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) reports, Active Session History (ASH), and SQL Monitoring for in-depth analysis.

**Utilizing Third-Party Tools:**

- Purpose: There are several third-party tools and services that can be integrated with Oracle APEX to provide additional monitoring and diagnostics.

- How to Use: Tools like Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM), New Relic, or SolarWinds can provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

**Performance Tuning Utilities:**

- Purpose: Oracle APEX includes utilities specifically designed for performance tuning.

- How to Use: Use utilities like the “Performance Tuning” option in SQL Workshop to analyze and optimize the performance of your SQL scripts.

**Real-Time SQL Monitoring:**

- Purpose: For real-time monitoring of SQL query performance.

- How to Use: This can be accessed via Oracle Enterprise Manager or SQL Developer. It provides detailed metrics on SQL execution, which is crucial for tuning complex queries.

**Automated Health Check Reports:**

- Purpose: To provide an overview of the health and performance of your APEX environment.

- How to Use: These can be scheduled or run ad-hoc and offer insights into system health, potential bottlenecks, and areas for optimization.

!!! info "Remember, the key to effective use of these tools is regular monitoring and not just when issues arise. Proactive monitoring helps in identifying potential performance issues before they become critical, allowing for a more stable and efficient APEX application."
